## Overview

This repository is dedicated to exploring and documenting technical debt in open-source Java projects. Technical debt refers to the accumulated cost of additional work needed to fix and maintain code that was expediently implemented but not properly refactored. By analyzing various Java projects, we aim to identify common patterns of technical debt, understand their impact, and propose strategies for mitigation.

## Motivation

Understanding and managing technical debt is crucial for the long-term health and sustainability of software projects. By focusing on open-source Java projects, we can gain insights into how different development teams handle technical debt, learn from their experiences, and contribute to the broader community's knowledge.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community. If you have insights, data, or tools related to exploring technical debt in Java projects, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Please review our [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before getting started.

## Setup

To get started with exploring technical debt in Java projects, follow the steps in the [Setup Guide](docs/setup.md). This guide provides instructions for setting up your development environment, installing necessary dependencies, and running analysis tools.

## Data Collection

The [Data Collection](docs/data-collection.md) section outlines the methodology and tools used to collect data from open-source Java projects. It provides details on the criteria for project selection, data extraction techniques, and any considerations for data privacy and ethical use.

## Analysis

Our analysis focuses on identifying technical debt patterns, categorizing debt types, and assessing their impact on project maintainability. Check the [Analysis](docs/analysis.md) section for details on our approach and findings.

## Results

The [Results](docs/results.md) section presents a summary of our key findings, including common technical debt patterns, insights into how projects manage debt, and recommendations for improving code quality and maintainability.
